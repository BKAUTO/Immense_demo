  - text: "On an autumn day in 859, a dragon appears, as if hovering over the whimsical waves of the Mediterranean Sea. It cuts through the water heading for North Africa. The dragon's head is carved at the front of a magnificent Viking ship from Scandinavia. The captain is the legendary Viking Bj√∂rn Ironside, joined by his valorous companion Hasting. Ignited by the desire for adventure and riches, the entire fleet of 62 ships sails for Rome."
